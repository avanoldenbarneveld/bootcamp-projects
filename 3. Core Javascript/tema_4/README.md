# Multiplication Loop

## 📌 Description
This exercise prompts the user for two numbers, multiplies them, and displays the result in an **alert message**. The process repeats indefinitely until manually stopped.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter:
   - **First number**
   - **Second number**
2. The program verifies the input and ensures both values are valid numbers.
3. It calculates the multiplication result and displays it in an **alert box**.
4. The process repeats in an **infinite loop**, allowing continuous calculations until manually stopped.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML** → Page structure.
- **JavaScript** → Input handling, validation, and calculations.

## 🖥️ Usage
1. **Open the `Exercise4.7.html` file in a browser.**
2. **Enter two numbers** when prompted.
3. **View the multiplication result in an alert message.**
4. **Close the alert** to restart the process.
5. **Manually close the browser tab** to stop execution.

## 📌 Notes
- Ensures only **valid numeric inputs** are accepted.
- Uses an **infinite loop**, requiring manual interruption.
- Uses `prompt()` and `alert()` for user interaction.
