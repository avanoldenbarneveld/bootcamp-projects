# JavaScript Exercises

This repository contains various exercises completed during the **Core JavaScript** module of the bootcamp. Each topic covers different aspects of JavaScript, including functions, async programming, testing, and DOM manipulation.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
Each folder represents a different topic (`tema_X`), and within them are the exercises.

```
javascript-exercises/
â”œâ”€â”€ tema_3/  # Basic HTML & JavaScript integration
â”œâ”€â”€ tema_4/  # More advanced HTML/JS exercises
â”œâ”€â”€ tema_5/  # JavaScript logic, functions
â”œâ”€â”€ tema_6/  # Unit testing with Jest
â”œâ”€â”€ tema_7/  # More complex JS logic
â”œâ”€â”€ tema_8/  # String transformations
â”œâ”€â”€ tema_9/  # Additional JS challenges
â”œâ”€â”€ tema_10/ # JavaScript & DOM
â”œâ”€â”€ tema_11/ # JavaScript & Browser APIs
â”œâ”€â”€ tema_12/ # Final JS projects
```

## ðŸš€ Topics Covered
- **Basic JavaScript** (variables, functions, loops, arrays, objects)
- **DOM Manipulation** (interacting with HTML & CSS using JavaScript)
- **Asynchronous JavaScript** (callbacks, promises, async/await)
- **Unit Testing** (using Jest for test-driven development)
- **Advanced JavaScript Concepts** (closures, higher-order functions, string manipulation)

## ðŸ”§ Running the Exercises
Some exercises require **Node.js**. To run a script:
```bash
node tema_X/exercise.js
```
To run tests:
```bash
npm test tema_X/exercise.test.js
```

## ðŸ“– Notes
- Each topic has a **README.md** explaining the key concepts.
- Some exercises include **unit tests** (`.test.js`).
- ESLint configuration is provided in some folders for code consistency.
